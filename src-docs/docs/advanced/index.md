*DuGR* enables you to **group layers** in After Effects, and **isolate the display of these groups**. It is an essential tool to simplify the management of compositions with lots of layers, without any need to precompose!

To make it easier for people with basic scripting abilities to use DuGR in their own scripts, automation, auto-rigs, etc, *DuGR* also comes with an easy-to-use API. It may also be very useful to advanced developpers though, as it also includes a lot of low-level methods and a very comprehensive scripting framework for After Effects and more generally for Adobe Applications.

It is written in *[ExtendScript](http://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/)* with the standard *[After Effects API](http://ae-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)*.

If you've never written any script for After Effects, you may start by learning how to create advanced *[expressions](http://ae-expressions.docsforadobe.dev/)* first, as they use the same language and an API very close to the *[After Effects scripting API](http://ae-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)*. Then you'll be able to write your first scripts.
