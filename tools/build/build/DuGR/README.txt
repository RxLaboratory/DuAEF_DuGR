# Installation

- Unzip the files you have downloaded.

You'll find several folders and files.

- *"LICENSE"* contains the license of DuGR, the [GNU-GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
- The *Help* folder contains the documentation. Double click on the file "index.html" to open it.
- The *ScriptUI Panels* folder contains the actual *DuGR* script you need to install.
- There are several easy methods to install DuGR, read the next sections.

!!! note
    When DuGR is installed for the first time, you'll need to restart After Effects to make it available.

## a. Copy the files

Copy all the files from the *ScriptUI Panels* folder to:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`  
- Mac OS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels`

You may need administrator privileges to install DuGR this way. If you don't have them, see the other methods below.

## b. Shortcut for After Effects CC2018 and more recent

- Open After Effects  
- *Windows*: Holding the [Alt] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the ScriptUI Panels files onto the project panel.  
- *Mac OS*: Holding the [Options] and [Shift] keys, drag and drop the ScriptUI Panels files onto the project panel.  

## c. Using the menu for After Effects CC2019 and more recent

- Open After Effects  
- Use the `File/Scritps/Install ScriptUI Panel...` menu to select and install the ScriptUI Panels files.  

# Without installation 

You'll always be able to run DuGR without even installing it. This is a good way to use it if you do not have administrator privileges on an older version of After Effects.

- Unzip all the files in any folder.  
- Launch After Effects, and start DuGR via the `File/Scripts/Run script file...` menu.
